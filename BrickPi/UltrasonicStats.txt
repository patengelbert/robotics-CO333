1.	Max-Dist = 2.54m
	Min-Dist = 0.05m

2.	Max-Angle = 45 degrees

3. 	Systematic Error = +0.01m

4	Deviation at 0.4m = 0.02m
	Deviation at 1.0m = 0.0m

5. 	Fraction of garbage readings < 1%

5.1. 	Further Comments - Relaibility decreases linearly between 2.0m and 2.54m
				Rapid changes at high distances are likely to cause error readings of 255
